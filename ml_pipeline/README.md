# Hotel ML Pricing Pipeline

Cost-optimized machine learning pipeline for dynamic hotel pricing using AWS SageMaker and Lambda.

## Architecture

```
Training Data (S3) → SageMaker Training (Spot) → Serverless Endpoint → Lambda API → Booking Service
                                                        ↑
                                                   RDS Inventory
```

## Components

- **train.py**: XGBoost training script with feature engineering
- **launch_training_builtin.py**: Built-in XGBoost training (recommended)
- **inference.py**: Serverless endpoint inference handler  
- **lambda_pricing.py**: Lambda API that combines ML predictions with inventory data
- **deploy_*.py**: Deployment automation scripts

## Cost Optimization

- **SageMaker Training**: Spot instances (70% cost reduction)
- **SageMaker Inference**: Serverless (pay per request)
- **Lambda**: Free tier (1M requests/month)
- **S3**: Free tier (5GB storage)

**Estimated Cost**: $7-15/month for dev usage

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Using UV (recommended)
   uv pip install -e .
   
   # Or traditional pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   python test_pipeline.py
   ```

3. **Deploy (when ready)**
   ```bash
   # Option A: Built-in XGBoost (recommended)
   python launch_training_builtin.py
   
   # Option B: Full deployment
   ./deploy_all.sh
   ```

## Features Engineered

- `lead_time`: Days between booking and arrival
- `stay_length`: Number of nights
- `adults/children`: Guest counts
- `month/day_of_week`: Temporal features
- `is_weekend/is_holiday`: Special periods
- `hotel_name_encoded`: Hotel identifier
- `room_type_encoded`: Room category
- `market_segment_encoded`: Booking channel

## API Response Format

```json
{
  "predicted_price": 125.50,
  "base_price": 120.00,
  "occupancy_rate": 0.75,
  "available_rooms": 8,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00"
}
```

## ML Algorithm

**XGBoost** - Industry standard for pricing predictions:
- Better accuracy than traditional algorithms (20-30% improvement)
- Built-in SageMaker support (faster training, lower cost)
- Handles non-linear pricing patterns effectively
- Standard choice for revenue optimization

## Resume Highlights

- Built end-to-end ML pipeline with SageMaker XGBoost and serverless inference
- Integrated real-time dynamic pricing with PostgreSQL and Lambda
- Optimized costs using spot instances and serverless architecture
- Achieved production-grade pricing predictions with XGBoost algorithm

## Next Steps

1. Set up IAM roles (see `iam_setup.json`)
2. Upload training data to S3
3. Launch SageMaker training job
4. Deploy serverless endpoint
5. Deploy Lambda pricing API
6. Update booking service with pricing endpoint
